## 1. Explain in detail the area graphs and line graphs in tableau and how to create them with examples. (With the help of an example create one in tableau)

### Area Graphs:
- Area graphs are used to display quantitative data over time, typically representing cumulative totals or proportions.
- The graph consists of filled areas bounded by lines, with the area between the lines filled with color.
- Area graphs are useful for comparing the overall values and relative proportions of different categories over time.
