## 3. What is the use of color and size options in the marks cart of tableau ? (With the help of an example create one in tableau).

Dataset Used: [World Cup](Datasets/world_cup_results.xlsx)

In Tableau, the color and size options in the Marks card allow you to encode additional information within your visualizations. They provide a way to visually represent data dimensions or measures, enhancing the understanding of patterns, comparisons, and relationships in your data.

The use of color and size options in the Marks card:

<b>Color</b>:
- The color option allows you to assign different colors to data points based on a chosen field or measure.
- It helps in highlighting categories, groups, or specific data points within your visualization.
- By assigning distinct colors to different categories, you can easily differentiate and compare them.

<b>Size</b>:
- The size option allows you to vary the size of data points based on a selected measure.
- It helps emphasize the magnitude or importance of a particular data point or value.
- By adjusting the size of data points, you can visually highlight trends or outliers in your visualization.

In this example we used both `Color` and `Size` options, we used `Home Goals` and `Away Goals` for `Color` and `WorldCupMatches` for `Size`, here `WorldCupMatches` increases goals of <b>Home</b> and <b>Away</b> goals increases.
