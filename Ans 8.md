`Distribution Band:` 
Distribution bands in Tableau, also known as box plots or box-and-whisker plots, are visualizations that provide insights into the distribution of data points. They display summary statistics such as median, quartiles, and outliers, allowing users to understand the spread, central tendency, and skewness of the data.

### Create Distribution Bands

- Right-click on the measure you want to analyze and select "Add Table Calculation."
- Choose the appropriate table calculation function for creating distribution bands, such as "Percentile," "Standard Deviation," or "Box Plot."
- Adjust the parameters of the table calculation function to define the desired level of detail and the range of the distribution bands.
