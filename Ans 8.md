## 8. Explain in detail the distribution bands in tableau and how to create them with example (With the help of an example create one in tableau)

Dataset Used: [Super Store](Datasets/sample_-_superstore.xls)

`Reference distribution:` 
The reference distribution is a distribution that uses the reference line for the division. The visualization is distributed in some parts with the help of a reference line as it works as a distribution boundary between these parts of the visualization.

### Create Distribution Bands

- Right-click on the measure you want to analyze and select "Add Table Calculation."
- Choose the appropriate table calculation function for creating distribution bands, such as "Percentile," "Standard Deviation," or "Box Plot."
- Adjust the parameters of the table calculation function to define the desired level of detail and the range of the distribution bands.
